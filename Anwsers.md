**Question 1:** I would set the length method to return 0 in my SortedLinkedList class and the rest of the methods to return what an empty list would return.  My test would consist of making a new SortedLinkedList and assert that the new SortedLinkedList's length is 0.

**Question 2:** I would use the insert method to create a new Node within the created SortedLinkedList and assert that the length of the list will be equal to 1.
